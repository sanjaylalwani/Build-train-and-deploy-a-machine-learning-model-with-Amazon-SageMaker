# Build-train-and-deploy-a-machine-learning-model-with-Amazon-SageMaker
With this project, we will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a machine learning (ML) model using the XGBoost ML algorithm.
The model will be trained on the Bank Marketing Data Set that contains information on customer demographics, responses to marketing events, and external factors.
Data Set has been taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing
